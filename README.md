# CROPSR-C
Initial working conversion of the CROPSR software at https://github.com/H2muller/CROPSR from Python into C++

This repo contains a .exe file which uses the same parameters as the original Python version to operate. It also contains the .cpp file as is, should there be a need for modification. Sample inputs and compile instructions for windows are included in the .cpp file.
