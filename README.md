# CROPSR-C
Initial working conversion of the CROPSR software at https://github.com/H2muller/CROPSR from Python into C++

This repo contains a precompiled .exe file which can be directly run from the terminal and uses the same parameters as the original Python version to operate. It also contains the .cpp file as is, should there be a need for modification or recompilation. Sample inputs and compile instructions for windows are included in the .cpp file.
